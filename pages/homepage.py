    **Objective:** Predict water potability based on water quality metrics.
    **Goal:** Build an MLOps pipeline that tracks experiments, versions data and models, and deploys a desktop app for easy predictions.

    st.write("""
    - **Experiment Setup:** Use a pre-configured Cookiecutter template and initialize Git for version control.
    - **MLflow Tracking:** Log experiments and model metrics on DagsHub using MLflow.
    - **DVC Pipeline:** Set up data versioning with DVC and build a robust ML pipeline.
    - **Model Registration:** Register the best model in MLflowâ€™s registry for easy deployment.
    - **Desktop Application:** Create a Tkinter app that fetches the latest model from MLflow and performs predictions.
